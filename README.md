Driven, enthusiastic and empathetic full-stack developer. A fast learner with experience in Ruby and JavaScript, I’ve recently graduated from Makers Academy. After several years building a career around my love of cycling, I relished the fresh challenge of Makers and am excited to build a new life as a developer.

### Skills

#### Drive and follow through - Project management??

Over consecutive years I took the concept of a "Cycling Demo Day" on Box Hill from a small gathering of regular customers and one or two niche brands to a large event attracting global brands like BMC, Look, Cervelo and Assos. It became a cornerstone of our sales projections for the year and companies like Canyon even reached out for advice on running their own, similar events.

#### Leadership

Working with a small core team and a wider cast of part-time staff means that clear and open communication is vital. At Maison Du Velo we don't necessarily have the number of people necessary to have specialised roles for things like event management, online sales, social media communications so I instituted and lead short daily task settings and weekly 'lessons leanry' meetings. This helped us to make sure we remained on the same page, made efficient use of our time and energy and that no customers or projects were neglected. It meant that ultimately we were able to expand the business from one to two shops, with a third in the pipeline, without expanding our core staff. More than that it also helped to ensure a harmonious and happy working environment that I was very sad to leave 

#### Communication

Building customer base with weekly rides. Interviews in cycling press - quoted as ask the expert

Project work - create open, honest environment and to knowledge share


#### Collaboration / Team Work

MDV - collaborating with designers, reps and distributors to problem solve and arrange mutually beneficial buying agreements

Makers - projects - swapping roles, etc etc

#### Extras to mention

- Organising trips!
- Overhaul of sales strategy


## Education

#### Makers Academy (May 2020 Start)

- A 16 week intensive coding bootcamp, relying primarily on **self-led learning**

## Hobbies

Sports in general, and cycling in particular, take up a lot of my free time. I have spent the last few years training hard and competing at a high level in road races across the country. For the 2018/19 season I took on a management role with the 1904RT men’s and women’s racing team which meant juggling budgets, securing sponsorships and organising 2 road races. I even managed to fit in a Highland quadrathlon. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck I had planned to take a step back from sports in 2020 to focus on my career change. Now, as we can't currently travel or socialise, I'm trying to spend what little time isn't spent coding catching up on some reading, walking and buying groceries online!
